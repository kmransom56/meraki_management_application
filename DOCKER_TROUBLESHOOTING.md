# Docker Troubleshooting Guide - AI-Powered Network Management

## Issue: Docker Build Hanging or Freezing

### Problem Description
The `docker-compose build --no-cache` command hangs up and freezes, preventing the AI-powered application from being containerized.

### Root Cause Analysis
Based on the error messages:
- Docker Desktop Linux Engine is not accessible
- Server returns 500 Internal Server Error
- Docker daemon is not running properly

### Solution Steps

#### 1. Restart Docker Desktop
```bash
# Close Docker Desktop completely
# Restart Docker Desktop from Windows Start Menu
# Wait for Docker Desktop to fully initialize (green icon in system tray)
```

#### 2. Alternative: Run Application Directly with Python
While Docker issues are resolved, you can run the AI-powered application directly:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:\Users\keith.ransom\Utilities\cisco-meraki-cli

# Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the AI-powered application directly
python app.py
```

#### 3. Docker Desktop Troubleshooting
If Docker Desktop continues to have issues:

**Option A: Reset Docker Desktop**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to Settings â†’ Troubleshoot
3. Click "Reset to factory defaults"
4. Restart Docker Desktop

**Option B: Switch Docker Engine**
1. Open Docker Desktop Settings
2. Go to General
3. Try switching between WSL 2 and Hyper-V backends
4. Apply & Restart

**Option C: Check Windows Services**
1. Open Services (services.msc)
2. Ensure these services are running:
   - Docker Desktop Service
   - com.docker.service

#### 4. Lightweight Docker Build (When Docker is Working)
Instead of `--no-cache`, try incremental build:

```bash
# Build without cache clearing (faster)
docker-compose build

# Or build specific service only
docker-compose build cisco-meraki-cli

# Alternative: Use docker build directly
docker build -t cisco-meraki-cli-enhanced .
```

#### 5. Docker Build Optimization
To prevent future hanging issues, the Dockerfile has been optimized with:
- Multi-stage builds for faster compilation
- Layer caching for dependencies
- Reduced image size with slim base images
- Proper cleanup of temporary files

### Testing the AI-Powered Application

#### Direct Python Execution
```bash
# Set environment variables
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
set AI_MAINTENANCE_ENABLED=true

# Run the application
python app.py
```
